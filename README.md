**Blaze Components Test**
Testing repository for Blaze Components, to be deleted after solving the problem.

I've never worked with Meteor packages on Github before, so I didn't know if I should create separate repositories for brajt:lib and brajt:core. Well, at least you can see the full code now.

Thanks a lot for help!
